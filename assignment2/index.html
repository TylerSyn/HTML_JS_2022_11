        <p>Hi, I'm Tyler Synott, I go to New England Institute of Technology. I'm going for game development and design currently. I'm going for these classes due to my interest in video games over the years. Ive played through many years of my life starting when I believe I was around 8. Due to that I've gathered an interest in games and am on a journey. I am still yet to know what part of the field I am going to lean towards when it comes to choosing development or design, but hope to find out which soon. Other than that I'm a full time college student that isn't currently working.
            I like to hang out with my friends after classes end. We usually figure out what we want to do as we get out. Sometimes we'll just talk and play pool, other times we may go to walmart and buy and play with rc cars. And due to days like this I can no longer trust a wendy's. And maybe we'll just chill out for the night and watch movies.
        </p>
